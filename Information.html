                    History of Football
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.

                <h2>
                    Football Rules
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Laws of the Game (LOTG) are the codified rules of association football. The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the frequently misinterpreted offside law, and many other laws that define the sport. During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were various attempts to codify football in England in the mid-19th century. The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed Football Association. The original Laws were heavily influenced by the Cambridge rules and their early development saw substantial influence from the Sheffield Rules. Over time the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International Football Association Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published in English, French, German and Spanish. A German translation of the latest 2019/2020 version is available on the FIFA website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary law book contains only the laws of the game. A more concise version consisting of only the law text itself, without commentary or illustrations, is provided as a booklet for football referees. This abbreviated version is called "The Laws of the Game: Quick Reference". A pocket format is also available in English only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The laws are formulated in broad terms to allow flexibility in their application. The referee has significant discretion in how to apply the laws in each game and as is often said, "The Laws are applied within the 'spirit' of the game and within the 'law' of the game". The laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition, and enforcement by the referees. In essence, the laws are more of a guide for referees as to how they should officiate the game and its various aspects.
